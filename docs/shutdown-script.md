# Shutdown Script

- Copy the files from the [BOOT](/shutdown/BOOT) folder to the "EFI/BOOT".
     - [Mount EFI partition on MAC OS.](mount-efi-mac.md)
- Copy the [shutdown](/shutdown/shutdown) and [mount_efi.sh](/shutdown/mount_efi.sh) files to a folder and run the shutdown script to shut down your mac.

>  - The shutdown script was based on [coisadepro's 5470-shutdown-patch](https://github.com/coisadepro/5470-shutdown-patch).
>  - The efi_mount.sh script was developed by RehabMan and obtained from blackdragon74 [OSX-Debug project](https://github.com/black-dragon74/OSX-Debug).
